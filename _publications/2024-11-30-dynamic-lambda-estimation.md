This study explores predictive modeling techniques for estimating lambda, the price impact parameter, in high-frequency trading environments. Using weighted least squares and ARIMA modeling, the research aims to dynamically optimize market-making strategies while managing inventory risks. Additionally, a Bellman equation framework is employed to balance expected profit and inventory risk.
