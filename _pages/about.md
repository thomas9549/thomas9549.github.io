I am a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, majoring in Statistics with a second major in Financial Engineering. My research focuses on stochastic processes, financial modeling, and statistical methodologies, with applications in market making and exotic options pricing. I am passionate about blending theoretical insights with practical solutions to address complex problems in finance and statistics.

Outside of academics, I am a passionate musician and a huge fan of classical piano, having practiced for 12 years. My favorite composer is Chopin. I also enjoy singing and performing with my universityâ€™s a cappella group. In my free time, I love playing tennis and staying active, which helps me balance my academic and creative pursuits.

I am currently preparing to puruse a PhD, I aim to contribute to advancing statistical methodologies while bridging theory and practice to solve complex real-world problems in high-dimensional systems.
